## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python:** Version 3.5 or higher (as noted in some notebooks) is recommended.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For running the `.ipynb` files.
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
* **Scikit-Learn:** Version 0.20 or higher is required.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Abdullah-Engineer/Hands-on-Machine-Learning.git](https://github.com/Abdullah-Engineer/Hands-on-Machine-Learning.git)
    cd Hands-on-Machine-Learning
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, you can generate one after installing necessary libraries for the notebooks by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

4.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a browser window with the Jupyter interface, from where you can navigate to and open the `.ipynb` files.

## Key Topics Covered

Here are the fundamental topics and algorithms explored within this repository, corresponding to each chapter:

### Chapter 1 - The Machine Learning Landscape

* **Objective:** To provide a foundational understanding of what Machine Learning is, why it's used, and its various types.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Definition and benefits of Machine Learning.
    * Overview of different ML systems: supervised vs. unsupervised learning, batch vs. online learning, instance-based vs. model-based learning.
    * Introduction to common challenges in ML (e.g., insufficient data, nonrepresentative data, overfitting, underfitting).

### Chapter 2 - End-to-End Machine Learning Project

* **Objective:** To guide through a complete machine learning project lifecycle, from data acquisition to model deployment, simulating a real-world data scientist's workflow.
* **Dataset:** California Housing Prices dataset (from StatLib repository, based on the 1990 California census).
* **Main Steps Covered in an ML Project:**
    1.  Looking at the big picture and framing the problem.
    2.  Getting and loading the data (e.g., using `fetch_housing_data`).
    3.  Discovering and visualizing the data to gain insights (e.g., scatter plots, histograms).
    4.  Preparing the data for Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., data cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, creating custom transformers).
    5.  Selecting and training a model.
    6.  Fine-tuning the model (e.g., using GridSearchCV).
    7.  Presenting the solution.
    8.  Launching, monitoring, and maintaining the system.

* **Key Concepts:**
    * MNIST as a benchmark "Hello World" dataset for classification.
    * Dataset structure and manipulation in Scikit-Learn.
