## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher is recommended.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For running the `.ipynb` files.
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Abdullah-Engineer/Hands-on-Machine-Learning.git](https://github.com/Abdullah-Engineer/Hands-on-Machine-Learning.git)
    cd Hands-on-Machine-Learning
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You might need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all necessary libraries for your notebooks.)*

4.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a browser window with the Jupyter interface, from where you can navigate to and open the `.ipynb` files.

## Key Topics Covered (Examples)

Here are some of the fundamental topics and algorithms explored within this repository, exemplified by the chapters provided:

### Chapter 3: Classification

* **Objective:** To introduce and demonstrate core concepts of classification using the MNIST dataset.
* **Dataset:** MNIST (70,000 images of handwritten digits).
* **Concepts Covered:**
    * Data loading and initial exploration.
    * Binary classification (e.g., distinguishing "5" from other digits).
    * Multiclass classification (classifying all 10 digits).
    * **Algorithms:** Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier, Logistic Regression.
    * **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall Curve, ROC Curve, AUC.
    * Importance of metrics beyond accuracy for imbalanced datasets.

### Chapter 4: Training Models (Linear Regression)

* **Objective:** To explain and implement various methods for training Linear Regression models.
* **Concepts Covered:**
    * Fundamentals of Linear Regression and its application.
    * **Cost Function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE).
    * **Analytical Solution:** The Normal Equation for direct parameter calculation.
    * **Iterative Optimization:** Introduction to Gradient Descent (Batch GD, Stochastic GD, Mini-batch GD – *implied further content*).
    * Synthetic data generation and visualization for understanding linear relationships.
