# Hands-on Machine Learning ‚Äì Code Repository

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for Chapters 1 and 2 of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow ‚Äì Second Edition* by Aur√©lien G√©ron. It serves as a practical resource for learners and practitioners aiming to understand the foundational concepts of machine learning.([GitHub][1])

## üìö Contents

The repository includes the following notebooks:

* **Chapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape**

  * An overview of the machine learning field, including key concepts, types of learning, and real-world applications.
  * Introduction to essential tools and libraries used in machine learning.

* **Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project**

  * A comprehensive walkthrough of a real-world machine learning project.
  * Covers data acquisition, exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment considerations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To effectively utilize the notebooks in this repository, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.6 or higher**
* **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**
* **Anaconda Distribution** (recommended for managing packages and environments)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdullah-Engineer/Hands-on-Machine-Learning.git
   cd Hands-on-Machine-Learning
   ```



2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```



3. **Install Required Packages:**

   It's advisable to use the Anaconda distribution, which comes with most of the required packages. However, you can install any missing packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



*Note: If `requirements.txt` is not provided, manually install the necessary libraries as you encounter import errors.*

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```



Navigate to the cloned repository folder and open the desired notebook.

## üß∞ Key Libraries and Tools

The notebooks utilize the following Python libraries:

* `NumPy`
* `Pandas`
* `Matplotlib`
* `Scikit-Learn`
* `TensorFlow`
* `Keras`([Linktree][2], [GitHub][3], [GitHub][1])

Ensure these libraries are installed in your environment to run the notebooks without issues.
